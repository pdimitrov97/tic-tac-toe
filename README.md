# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game written in C as part of my coursework at university.

## Description
Tic-Tac-Toe or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

## How to use it
When started the program asks if you want to play agains another user or against the computer. Next you are asked to enter your name and whether you want to play with the X or with the O. When the game is started you are prompted to enter the position of the mark you want place. The format of the position is of type letter and number joint together (e.g. a1, b2, c3) which represent the corresponding row and column. Entering <b>q</b> at any input stage terminates the program.
